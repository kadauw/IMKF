### 01 Introduction to 3D Scanning

3D scanning is the process of capturing the three-dimensional shape and, sometimes, appearance of a real-world object or environment using a specialized device called a 3D scanner. In simpler terms, it's like taking a digital snapshot of an object in all its 3D glory. 3D scanning is like taking a mold of an object, but instead of a physical mold, you get a digital one that can be easily edited, shared, and used for various purposes. The best type of 3D scanner for a particular application depends on the object's size, complexity, desired level of accuracy, and budget.

3D scanning makes this possible to take a real-world object and bring it into the digital world It's like magic, but with some serious technology behind it. 
Here's a glimpse into what 3D scanning is all about:

•	Bridging the Physical and Digital Divide: 3D scanners act like superpowered cameras, capturing the exact shape and, in some cases, color of a physical object. Imagine a camera that takes millions of measurements instead of a flat picture!

•	Creating Digital Twins: This captured data is then used to build a digital 3D model, a precise replica of the real object. This digital twin allows you to view, manipulate, and analyze the object in a virtual environment.

•	A World of Technologies: Different 3D scanners use various techniques to achieve this capture. Lasers, structured light patterns, and even sound waves are some of the tools in the 3D scanning toolbox.

Instead of taking a physical cast of an object, 3D scanning creates a digital one. This digital mold offers incredible benefits:
+ 	Easy Editing and Manipulation: Unlike a physical mold, the digital 3D model can be easily edited, scaled, and modified on a computer.
+ 	Sharing Made Simple: Digital files are easy to share and store, allowing collaboration and remote work on scanned objects.
+  Unlocking New Applications: 3D scanned models have a wide range of uses, from creating 3D printed replicas to designing new products or preserving historical artifacts.

### 03	Types of 3D Scanning

There are two main categories of 3D scanning technologies:
A) Contact 
B) and Non-contact.


#### A) Contact Scanning:
As the name suggests, contact scanners physically touch the surface of the object to capture its shape. A probe or stylus on the scanner moves across the object, taking measurements at numerous points.


![Types of 3D Scanning](https://www.skz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder/_Forschung/Prozess/Additive%20Fertigung/Overview-Additive-Manufacturing.png)

Here's a breakdown of the two main types of contact scanners:
1)	Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs)
    •	CMMs are the workhorses of contact scanning, offering high accuracy and versatility.
    •	They have a fixed frame with a motorized arm that holds a touch probe.
    •	The probe physically touches the surface of the object at numerous points, taking precise measurements of its X, Y, and Z coordinates.
    •	CMMs can be programmed to follow complex paths, capturing data from intricate shapes.


2)	Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMMs)
    •	AACMMs offer more flexibility compared to traditional CMMs.
    •	They have a portable arm with multiple joints, allowing for greater reach and manoeuvrability.
    •	Like CMMs, they utilize a touch probe that captures data points by physically touching the object's surface.
    •	AACMMs are well-suited for scanning large or awkwardly shaped objects that wouldn't fit under a traditional CMM.




#### B) Non-Contact Scanning:
Non-contact scanners, on the other hand, capture the object's shape without physically touching it. These scanners use various technologies like lasers, structured light, or even sound waves to gather data about the object's surface.

Here are some of the most common types of non-contact 3D scanning:
1) Laser Scanning
    •	Uses a laser beam to measure the distance to the object's surface from the scanner.
    •	Creates highly accurate 3D models.


![Types of 3D Scanning](https://www.skz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder/_Forschung/Prozess/Additive%20Fertigung/Overview-Additive-Manufacturing.png)

2) Computed Tomography (CT)
Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is a type of 3D scanning technology that uses X-rays to capture detailed internal and external images of an object. Unlike traditional 3D scanners that capture data from the surface of an object, CT scanners can create a 3D representation of the object's entire volume.

Here are some common applications of CT 3D scanning:
+	Medical Imaging: In the medical field, CT scans are widely used for diagnosing injuries, diseases, and abnormalities within the body.
+	Reverse Engineering: CT scanning is used in reverse engineering to create digital models of existing physical objects for analysis, improvement, or creating compatible parts.
+	Quality Control: In manufacturing, CT scans can be used to inspect products for internal defects or to ensure they meet design specifications.
+	Paleontology: CT scanning is used in paleontology to study the internal structures of fossils, providing valuable insights into the anatomy and biology of extinct creatures.


CT scanning offers several advantages over other 3D scanning techniques:
+ 	High Accuracy: CT scans can produce highly accurate 3D models, even for complex objects with intricate internal structures.
+ 	Non-Destructive: Like other 3D scanning methods, CT scanning is non-destructive, meaning it doesn't damage the object being scanned.
+ 	Internal Imaging: Unlike most 3D scanners that only capture surface data, CT scans can reveal internal features and structures.

However, there are also some limitations to consider:
+ 	Cost: CT scanners are expensive machines, and the scanning process can be costly.
+ 	Radiation Exposure: CT scans involve exposure to ionizing radiation, which can be harmful in high doses.
+ 	Scan Size Limitations: The size of the object that can be scanned is limited by the size of the CT scanner's opening.



3) Structured Light Scanning:
+ 	Projects a pattern of light onto the object and analyzes the way it deforms to create a 3D model.
+ 	Faster than laser scanning and good for capturing color data.

4) Photogrammetry:
+ 	Uses multiple photographs of an object from different angles to create a 3D model.
+ 	More affordable option but may not be as accurate as other methods.

5) White Light Scanning:
Uses a projector to bathe the object in white light and multiple cameras to capture the reflected light from different angles.
•	Can capture high-resolution 3D models and color data quickly.
   








### 04 	Processes of 3D Scanning

AThe 3D scanning process can be broken down into three main stages:

Preparation:
•	Object Setup: This involves properly positioning the object on a turntable or platform for optimal scanning. Sometimes, markers or targets are placed on the object to aid in data alignment during post-processing.
•	Scanner Settings: The scanner settings are adjusted based on the object's size, material (reflective surfaces can be tricky), and desired level of detail. Resolution and scan speed are some of the key settings to consider.

Scanning:
•	Data Capture: Depending on the type of scanner, a laser beam, structured light pattern, or sound waves are used to capture data points from the object's surface. Millions of data points are collected, representing the object's geometry.
•	Multiple Scans (if necessary): For complex objects with many nooks and crannies, multiple scans from different angles might be required to capture the entire surface.

Post-Processing:
•	Data Alignment: The captured data points from potentially multiple scans need to be aligned and merged to create a complete 3D model. Software tools are used to identify matching points across scans and stitch them together seamlessly.
•	Noise Reduction: The raw scan data might contain some noise or errors. Filtering and cleaning techniques are applied to remove unwanted elements and ensure the accuracy of the 3D model.
•	Mesh Refinement: The aligned data points are converted into a 3D mesh, a digital representation of the object's surface. Mesh refinement techniques can be used to optimize the mesh for specific applications, like 3D printing or animation.
•	Model Export: The final 3D model can be exported in various file formats compatible with different design or manufacturing software for further use.



Here are some additional points to consider:
•	Calibration: Some 3D scanners require regular calibration to ensure accuracy.
•	Real-time Scanning: While some scanners capture data in a single pass, others capture data continuously, allowing for real-time visualization of the 3D model during the scanning process.
•	Software plays a crucial role: Sophisticated software is used to control the scanner, process the captured data, and generate the final 3D model.

The specific steps and techniques within each stage may vary depending on the type of 3D scanner and the desired outcome.
