### 01 Introduction to Binder Jetting

Binder jetting (BJ) is an "additive manufacturing process in which a liquid binder is selectively applied to powder materials so that they bond" [2]. The English term "binder jetting" is often used and not the German term "Freistrahl-Bindemittauftrag", which is used according to the standard..



### 02	History of Binder Jetting

In 1993, The BJ process was developed and patented in 1993 by Emanuel ("Ely") Sachs and Michael Cima at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 1995, Z Corporation received an exclusive license for this process. The ZPrinter, as it is now called, has become one of the most popular commercial 3D printer lines and is offered in the latest generation as the "ProJet CJP" series.

in 1998 The patent was bought by other companies and ExOne (then still known as Extrude Hone) was able to present the first metal printer based on BJT technology.

2002 The first sand printers for producing sand cores for the foundry are launched on the market.

Today, binder jetting technology has mainly been used in research and industry.  Machines with installation spaces of up to 4 x 2 x 1 m are available for series production.









### 03	Processes of Binder Jetting

There are two main categories of 3D scanning technologies:

Binder jetting is an additive manufacturing (AM) process that utilizes a liquid binder to bind powder particles together, layer by layer, to create a three-dimensional object. It's akin to inkjet printing on a powder bed.



How does a BJ printer work?

Step 1: The storage container is raised and the build platform of the powder bed is lowered.

Step 2: The recoater applies a layer of powder with a defined layer height

Step 3: Überschüssiges Pulver wird in den Überlauf- bzw. Auffangbehälter transportiert.

Step 4: This is followed by the actual printing: The ink is applied drop by drop from the print head onto the powder layer. Only where ink is applied are the powder particles bonded together and a component is created. The remaining powder remains unbound, supports the components and can then be reused.

### 04 	Materials of Binder Jetting 

+ Powder:

The powders for binder jetting can vary greatly in terms of particle size and the materials used. The particle size depends on the desired layer height as well as the flowability of the powders used. The powder particles vary from the single-digit µm range up to approx. 500 µm. The aim is to achieve a smooth powder bed surface, which is only possible with a sufficiently flowable powder.
Binder jetting is described as an open-material process, as basically any material that fulfills the properties already mentioned can be printed. However, not every material "sticks" to the selected ink and a binder powder must be mixed in to bond the particles. Experience shows that good component properties can be achieved with approx. 5 - 15 % by weight of binder powder.

+ Ink:
The term "ink" refers to the printing fluid that is dripped from the print head and bonds the particles in the powder locally through a physical or chemical reaction. Inks for additive manufacturing can be water- or solvent-based. The ink can also be used to impart special physical properties such as color, electrical conductivity, etc. to the component. The exact composition of the ink varies depending on the requirements of the print head and the setting behavior with the powder. Ink development is usually very time-consuming and cost-intensive.

### 05	Applications of 3D Scanning  

3D scanning has revolutionized various industries by enabling the creation of digital replicas of real-world objects. Here's a glimpse into the diverse applications of this technology:

Design and Manufacturing:
•	Reverse Engineering: Analyze existing products to understand their design and functionality, potentially for improvement or creating compatible parts.
•	Prototyping: Rapidly create physical prototypes of new designs using 3D printing from scanned data.
•	Quality Control: Ensure parts meet design specifications by comparing scanned models to digital CAD models.
•	Custom Manufacturing: Create customized products based on individual needs using scanned data.
